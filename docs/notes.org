* Why implement login ourselves, instead of shelling out to 'npm login'?

Because, writing username and password to the stdin of the =npm login=
process, seems unreliable.

* Why we write to .npmrc by hand, and not use =@npm/config= like we did for 'npm login'?

Because consuming the library was tedious.

#+begin_src js
let npmConfig = new Config({
  npmPath: this.#npmRoot,
  definitions,
  flatten,
  shorthands,
});
#+end_src

It's not easy to construct
definitions. =lib/utils/config/definitions.js= is a long list of,

#+BEGIN_SRC js
define('<key>'
, {
  default: null,
  type: [null, Boolean],
  short: 'y',
  description: `...`,
})
#+END_SRC
