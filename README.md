A tool to make it easier to package C libraries and tools for [esy](esy.sh)

Note: On Windows, it works only within mingw/cygwin environment since esy provides this environment anyway.

## Development

(Currently Windows only) Set `NODE_ENV` to `development` to enable sourcemaps at the node wrapper. Not useful inside the JS realm.
